## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-09

### Added

- Emit a `#define <UPPER_STEM>_GUID "{...}"` macro in every generated C

### Changed

- Thread `base_index` through field members, C headers, and the model
  description.
- Default `generation_time` to the fixed FMI epoch for reproducible output.
- Resolve export candidates by stored key; declare library imports in fixtures.
- Harden the ecosystem CI workflows and seed the `CHANGELOG.md`.
